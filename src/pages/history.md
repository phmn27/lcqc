Founded in 1992, it was created by friends and acquaintances of an entrepreneur, and according to its customers, it is “handmade.”

Right in front of Zihuatanejo Bay, you’ll find this exclusive adults-only resort.

One of the special features of this hotel is that half of the rooms have their own private pool. Its architectural design highlights the folk art of the region, as well as its attractive handmade designs in Talavera and clay. La Casa que Canta is a small hotel with its own essence, history, and personality.

This small resort houses 25 suites distributed across three buildings.

All rooms have spacious terraces and 180-degree views of the bay. In this world of peace, a universe has been created with special attention to details and always respecting the well-being of guests.

The suites create an atmosphere of total privacy, while their decoration is uniquely traditional, including their own pool and a spacious living room to enjoy with friends or your partner. Among the services offered by the suites are king-size beds, desks, a safe, goose feather pillows, wireless internet access, and a minibar.

The resort has an exclusive restaurant suspended above the sea and built on different levels next to a pool, offering breathtaking views of the bay.

The Mar & Cielo restaurant offers a menu inspired by contemporary Mexican cuisine, specializing in seafood with a European touch. Some of the standout dishes include shrimp pozole, guajillo shrimp with mushrooms, and baked fish in banana leaf with pineapple, onion, habanero chili, and jasmine.
